This is a bit of a personal post, since this has actually forced me to look at some things about myself that I don't like to look at. I hope that it will resonate with someone who's facing similar challenges.

So someone asks for a change. Devs estimate it will take 3 months to make the change. Nonsense, I can do it in a few hours ... after all  I'm a Data Science Unicorn ... 6 months later, "can you add in another feature"? Suddenly it's not so easy any more ... how did I do it again? The hack that took 3 hours to build, suddenly takes 3 weeks to update. (not exaggerating here)

I've been wanting to get started with unit testing for a while, and am especially motivated since reading [Sam Savages recent LinkedIn article about the need for modernising analytics development workflows][1]. Our Data services team has recently stared automated testing (mostly functional testing from what I'm told, as unit tests can be less useful for Data Pipelines). But the barrier to entry has always been too high for me, learning a bunch of new tools etc. So I wanted to see if I could get stared just using some simple shell scripts.

A big thing has been fixing my workflow: i always used to just copy and paste bits of code into consoles (maybe this comes from having a Mathematica background where it was never important to have a "complete running version of code"). I've had to push myself to put things into script and run them from the command line. It's also forcing me to break things into logical chunks.

Also I'm learnign to try and "flow" more often; i've underestimated the imporance of this flow state for creating clean projects, thinking laterally, thinking creatively. One thing is not getting distracted while I'm waiting for a script to run, forcing myself to stay focused and in the zone rather than using that time to check emails or surf the web.

Previously I've alwasy told myself "work smarter not harder", so I'm always trying to find the perfect solution that will avoid the need for hard work. But often there is no perfect solution and it takes hard work to get to the solution. Of course the hard work also needs to be smart work or at least hard work in the right direction; for example learning CLI's and scripting instead of pointing and clicking (this is sort of "wasted flow", doing something in Excel for hours that I'm not going to remember a few weeks later when I'm asked to do the same thing again.) But things I've made excuses for (i'll learn GIT when I understand the perfect workflow; I'll use testing when I understand the perfect project directory structure) I've been really handicapping myself by just working in dribs and drabs and not giving myself the chance to immerse myself in my project. I've thought of myself as "I think of the big picture, I come to solutions quickly but I'm not someone that can get lost in code for hours" but this thinking has been holding me back, and I've decided to change this.

Of course the flip side is learning to ask for help when I get blocked ... this is still something that I'm very much working on. Part of it is giving my self the flow time to be really clear on what my problems are, so that when I do ask for help I can be much more to the point, instead of frazzled and needy (which is how I think I can come across now; I'm also really scared of asking for help because of this, and leave it much too long.)

I'm really stuggling to come to terms with the study about bright children not trusting their ability for hard work, and what this means for me; somehow I sabotage myself by not allowing myself to focus; maybe it's because I don't think that I have this ability (that's what I said just before isn't it!). Also I think that I'm very driven by a desire to please, or a desire for results (or often just a desire for distraction), rather than nurturing my inate curiosity. The flipside of this is at I'm pretty good at big picture thinking, and don't often get lost in the details. However this is something that I really want work on changing as well. Well it's time to change this story about myself, so that I can go to the next level.
