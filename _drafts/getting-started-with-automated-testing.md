title: Getting started with unit testing for data pipelines

I've been wanting to get started with unit testing for a while, and am especially motivated since reading [Sam Savages recent LinkedIn article about the need for modernising analytics development workflows][1]. Our Data services team has recently stared automated testing (mostly functional testing from what I'm told, as unit tests can be less useful for Data Pipelines). But the barrier to entry has always been to high for me, learning a bunch of new tools etc. So I wanted to see if I could get stared just using some simple shell scripts.
