I've recenlty been really disturbed with the practice of calling cluster computers "master" and "slave". When I did  blog post on [setting up a Hadoop cluster to run NLTK][1], I knew that I didn't want to use this terminology. I did a google search, but all I could find was a discssion on [what was the discussion??][2]
